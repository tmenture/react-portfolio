                My name is Thomas, I am a freshly certified Full Stack Web Developer.
                I have just finished my course and am eager to join the workforce.
            </p>

                Throughout this course I have grown to love coding. It is extremely interesting,
                with an evergrowing knowledge base. I have grown particularly fond of using the full stack
                to make applications, and on this page you will see some of the projects I have developed on 
                my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.
